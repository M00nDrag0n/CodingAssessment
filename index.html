      <div class="About">
          <span class="align-text-top">
              <p>I am a young dragon who graduated from high school because I'm a good dragon. I am also shy and my work experience is limited. My dad, who is a much larger dragon that lives in the water, told me he has friends who have gotten into coding. It is a very flexible job opportunity which may help me to pay for my own college eventually so I can become a scientific fusion which includes entomology, microbiology, and biotechnology. I am also learning Mandarin Chinese. I love to exist among plants and trees, I can imitate a wide variety of animals including birds, and I like to climb around and explore. I collect rocks and shells, as well as carefully researched plant specimens that can be dried and used to make tea from scratch. I also like to climb onto people's shoulders because I'm small enough to do that, and I might sometimes land on your head. When I'm hungry, I beg for food and I wiggle if I think I will get something good. I am very good at transporting bugs away from the humans so they don't have to worry about being bitten or crawled on by the poor, defenseless spiders. When I am bored and screwing around on my phone, I like to write stories and make people laugh. Some of these stories include "made-up Mad Libs" which is when I ask around for needed parts (nouns, verbs, etc) while writing the story, then I show the humans when the Mad Lib is completed.

     <div class="Data1">
       <p>This is a list of stuff that I am failing to accomplish:</p>
        <ol>
         <li>causing the "list of rocks" and "list of projects" divs to move separately</li>
         <li>causing the list of projects to have a fixed height to conserve space</li>
     </div>

    <div class="Data2">
       <p>This is a list of stuff I was able to figure out how to do</p>
        <ol>
         <li>position my About where I want it to be</li>
         <li>position text within "Plagiarism-Prevention" where I want it to be</li>
    </div>

    <div class="Data3">
       <p>Mistakes and Errors</p>
        <ol>
         <li>I somehow was holding the alt tab instead of shift and now Atom won't let me hit "enter" without a crazy list of "key binding resolvers" showing up with "editor inlines" and confusion. It's only cure is the space button.</li>
         <li>I messed with text margins, height, width, top, left, right, z-index, and various Bootstrap links, became frustrated with my inability to get my lists of stuff to function individually, then deleted their data in my CSS file. I tried making an extra closed div tag in case one wasn't closed but nothing happened.</li>

    </div>

    <div class="To-Do-List">
      <p>To-Do List</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Fix Atom</li>
          <li>Fix my div tags somehow</li>
          <li>Fix the text margin of my list of projects</li>
          <li>change background and text colors</li>
