        <div class="About">
          <p>I am a young dragon who graduated from high school because I'm a good dragon. I am also shy and my work experience is limited. My dad, who is a much larger dragon that lives in the water, told me he has friends who have gotten into coding. It is a very flexible job opportunity which may help me to pay for my own college eventually so I can become a scientific fusion which includes entomology, microbiology, and biotechnology. I am also learning Mandarin Chinese. I love to exist among plants and trees, I can imitate a wide variety of animals including birds, and I like to climb around and explore. I collect rocks and shells, as well as carefully researched plant specimens that can be dried and used to make tea from scratch. I also like to climb onto people's shoulders because I'm small enough to do that, and I might sometimes land on your head. When I'm hungry, I beg for food and I wiggle if I think I will get something good. I am very good at transporting bugs away from the humans so they don't have to worry about being bitten or crawled on by the poor, defenseless spiders. When I am bored and screwing around on my phone, I like to write stories and make people laugh. Some of these stories include "made-up Mad Libs" which is when I ask around for needed parts (nouns, verbs, etc) while writing the story, then I show the humans when the Mad Lib is completed.
